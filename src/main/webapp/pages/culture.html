We want to retain old talent and attract new one. 
Current problem: Old talent remains in the organization, new is hired but the new talent exists fast. 
 
Solution:
How do we nurture new talent :
 
1- Replace lead/subordinate relation by a mentor / owner relation
     Mentor facilitates an owner. If the owner has similar experience then allow the owener to take decisions and learn. 
2- Replace old gets the gold with all get a part of gold. THe old person will always get to choose the best work and trash will be given to the new employee with similar experience. 
 
3- move away from Serpant model : Old person sits like  a serpant and guards his code. 
 
4- replace "tech leader labels in the end"  by   "tech leader starts from the begining" model.
 
 
We create 3 rewards:
1- Nurture reward: How an old person mentors new hiers and helped them lead. 
2- Adapatability reward: How the old adapts to new technology and the new hiers adjusts to the culture. 
3-  Innovation reward: How old employee uses knowledge from new hires and created innovation from the old product. [ Experience and new tech meet ] 
4- Creativity reward: Anyone can get this , New hires are required for this reward. 
5- Integrity reward: we allow people to make mistakes , but we disallow repetation of those. 
6- latent/runner reward [ latent energy : The energy is there but it is latent , They want other people to take responsibility and stay in latent state facilitate the owner of the project. THe reward is given to people who cannot fully focus on work and are brave enough to accept it and let go , owning to the fact that product is more important rather than them remaining in power.  Women who are mothers of new born and are unable to give 100% to work. People who are going through treatment of a desease. their current position will not affect their bonus, nor it will affect their promotion. Because is not only delivering a specific value but also integirity and honesty. 
 
 
Benift: This will make the old employees less insecure. This will prevent them from laying obstacles in the way of new hires. 
It will be part of their job to facilitatte rather than limit. 
This will allow new hires to make decisions and take responsibility without appearing disrespectful to the old employee. and the old employee will also not feel contention of power. 
 
Outplacement Devision: Employees who want to explore other ventures or who do not fit in the current changing environment of the orginization may register themselves in the Outplacemnet division. Other companies can look for resources. An employee can be in an outplacemnet division for upto 6 months.  with partial contribution to the team and other teams.
