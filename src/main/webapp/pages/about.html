Our Mission :
Have you ever felt fear of manager as a new hire  HOw much shoudl I tell ? 
</br>
Should I question my manager ? If he is not fair to you have you just accepted it as helplessness. " If your manager is doing wrong things have you been scared to cross question her ? How can I cross question her she will be proven wrong ? SHe will be upset with me. I am suppose to coopeate with her and never raise questions on her handling of situation. 
</br> 
IF I go to HR the manager will try to protect her and everyone will support her. I will invite more trouble and stress, nothing will happen to her. I better look out for another job. 
 </br>
THese are the kind of situations that we will help people deal with. 
 </br>
Or have you been scared to tell the entire truth to the manager and felt more comforatble in telling her giving her an hint of a problem but stayed away from telling the exact behavior of abuser fearing that it may be considered fingure pointing, and U may be interupted as as team player.

How to protect your self. If the abuser is smart to completly behave differentlly with different people. then what do youdo ? How can HR help in these situations.  How can hte HR , ethics ensure that the victim is not abused further.   Just beacuse the abuser is nice with rest of the team, does not mean that the manager will conclude that the abuser cannot abuse other people
 </br>
There have been many times where I have been scared. Should I tell this to my manager. What will she think. Even now, after changing my job, I do ask questions to my manager , then write an email to her then fear what if she forward this to the HR. What will they do ?  Even now, HOw will this stop ? This situation should not occur in the first place. What are other companies doing/
</br> 
Can I just talk to the HR ? Or once the word is out of my mouth I am done ... They will tell it to my manager . my job will be at risk, they will spoil my relationship with anyone else ? My progress in the organization will be hindered, no one will want me to join their team. How will HR handle these delicate situation. First are the HR people qualified enough to resolve these issues without jeoparding the victims?
